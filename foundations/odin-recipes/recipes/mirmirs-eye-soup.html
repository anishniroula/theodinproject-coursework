          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p class="margin-top-12">
            Journey to the Well of Urðr with this hearty and enigmatic Mimir's
            Eye Soup. Inspired by the guardian of the Well of Wisdom, this dish
            features a single, prominent "eye" — a generously sized,
            herb-infused meatball — floating in a rich, amber broth brimming
            with the bounty of the earth. Root vegetables and verdant greens
            symbolize the deep knowledge and life sustained by Mimir's
            sacrifice, while the savory meatball represents the watchful,
            all-knowing gaze. A truly fulfilling and thought-provoking meal.

          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Prepare the "Mimir's Eye":</b> In a large bowl, combine the
              ground meat, breadcrumbs, chopped onion, minced garlic, beaten
              egg, parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly but gently
              until just combined. Form the entire mixture into one very large,
              firm meatball. If using, carefully press a slice of hard-boiled
              egg into the center of the meatball before fully shaping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sear the "Eye":</b> Heat a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven
              over medium-high heat. Add a splash of olive oil. Carefully sear
              the large meatball on all sides until well-browned. This will help
              it hold its shape and add flavor. Remove the meatball and set
              aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Sauté Aromatics:</b> In the same pot, add more olive oil if
              needed. Add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5-7
              minutes until the vegetables begin to soften.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Build the Broth:</b> Add the diced potatoes, beef or vegetable
              broth, and dried rosemary to the pot. Bring to a simmer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cook the Soup:</b> Carefully return the seared meatball to the
              pot, ensuring it is mostly submerged in the broth. Reduce heat to
              low, cover, and simmer for at least 30-45 minutes, or until the
              meatball is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Add Greens:</b> Stir in the chopped kale or spinach during the
              last 5-10 minutes of cooking until wilted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Season and Serve:</b> Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and
              pepper as needed. Ladle the soup into bowls, ensuring each serving
              gets a generous portion of broth and vegetables, crowned with the
              magnificent Mimir's Eye. Garnish with fresh dill or parsley.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
